# Herbert_2024_The-Effect-of-DNA-Extraction-Methodology-and-Sequencing-Chemistry
This repository contains the final R Markdown scripts for the analyses reported in 'Impacts of Microbial Molecular Methodology on Adaptive Sampling, 16S rRNA Gene Amplicon Profiling, and Metagenomics' (Herbert et al., 2024). All scripts have been modified to remove directory names, but are otherwise as used for creation of the figures and data analyses reported in the manuscript. 

The following R Markdown scripts are provided:
1. **sq_comp_paper_analysis_published.Rmd** = This script outlines the analysis of the impact of DNA extraction kit and Nanopore sequencing chemistry on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing.
2. **RMD_SC_adaptive_analysis.Rmd** = This script outlines the analysis exploring the impact of Nanopore sequencing chemistry on adaptive sampling enrichment of the *S. cerevisiae* genome from the Zymobiomics Community Standard control sample. This script utilises data from across the entire sequencing run. 
3. **SC_adaptive_8_hour_bases.Rmd** = This script outlines the analysis exploring the impact of Nanopore sequencing chemistry on adaptive sampling enrichment of the *S. cerevisiae* genome from the Zymobiomics Community Standard control sample. This script utilises only reads generated within the first 8 hours of the sequencing run.
